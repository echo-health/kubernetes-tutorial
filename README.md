# kubernetes-tutorial
This assumes you have already [installed minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-macos)

This repository is intended to teach what the abstractions are in Kubernetes, how to use them and how to debug them. Each exercise is self contained, but it is recommended to start at exercise 1 if you are a beginner.

- [Exercise 1: Deployments](deployments.md)
- [Exercise 2: Services](services.md)
- [Exercise 3: Config maps and secrets](config.md)
