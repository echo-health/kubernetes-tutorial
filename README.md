# training-materials
This repository contains the training materials we use at Echo internally in order to upskill developers.

If you are contributing to this repo, create a folder named appropriately and include a README which should explain how to follow the material.

If you would like someone to run through any of the materials here, please ask in #engineering on Slack or DM Charlotte. There will be regularly organised workshops on a team by team basis or when new people join, but you can also request refreshers.

If you would like material on particular topics, please ask in Slack.

If you have any feedback on any of the material, feel free to submit a pull request.
